# babun-agnoster

This is **sane***-ish* (localization is en_US and respects the original Solarized theme) install and config for Babun on Windows
with oh-my-zsh and Agnoster theme.

## Installation
1. Create Windows environment variable "HOME" with value "C:\Users\\\<your-username\>"
2. Copy .babunrc, .minttyrc and .zshrc to your User home (same as in (1)).
3. Set DEFAULT_USER in .zshrc to your username
4. Install the Powerline fonts provided with this package

   Alternative:
   Put the fonts somewhere for permanent storage and _after_ Babun installation (see (5)) run following command from Windows cmd:
   \<babun-install-directory\>\fonts\RegisterFont.exe add "\<path-to-powerline-fonts\>\DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline.ttf"
5. Install Babun from babun.github.io (ignore the "HOME variable set" warning and install anyway)
